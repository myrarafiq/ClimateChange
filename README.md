# üåç Who's to Blame for Climate Change?

**Project Type**: Climate Change Prediction & Modeling with R

In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius predicted that atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ levels could alter Earth's temperature. Over a century later, climate change is an urgent global issue. Countries meet annually at COP summits to set CO‚ÇÇ reduction targets ‚Äî but how do we know what's fair, and who should reduce the most?

This project explores which factors most strongly predict a country's CO‚ÇÇ emissions. We use data from the **World Bank**, train predictive models (including regression and neural networks), and forecast future emissions for 2020 to offer insights on what drives emissions and how they might be reduced.

## üì¶ Dataset

**Source**: [The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)  
**Scope**: Socio-economic and environmental indicators for countries over multiple years  
**Target Variable**: `co2_emission` (metric tons per capita)

**Predictors include**:
- GDP, population, trade, employment sectors  
- Land use, urbanization, life expectancy  
- Imports/exports, energy-related economic activity  

Full variable descriptions are available in the dataset file.

## üß™ Project Roadmap

### Part 1: EDA
- Visualized key features and explored relationships with CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- Identified population, GDP, trade, and industrial activity as strong predictors  

### Part 2: Baseline Model
- Created a simple **mean model** as a baseline  
- RMSE used to evaluate model performance  

### Part 3: Regression Models
- Trained multiple linear regression models  
- Explored variable combinations and multicollinearity  
- Best model (excluding `country` to avoid overfitting) had an RMSE of **2.3**

### Part 4: Neural Networks
- Scaled predictors between 0‚Äì1  
- Built and tested multiple neural networks  
- Compared to regression performance ‚Äî regression outperformed NN in this case  

### Part 5: Evaluation & Insights
- Used best model to predict **2020** emissions  
- RMSE increased slightly to **2.5**, likely due to COVID-19 disruptions  
- Key predictors included:
  - `population`
  - `gdp`
  - `life_expectancy`
  - `service_employment_per`
  - `trade_gdp_per`

## üìä Key Takeaways

- **Economic and demographic factors** are the strongest predictors of CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- Countries with large populations and industrial GDP tend to emit more  
- Models show promise for forward-looking **policy forecasting**  
- 2020 predictions matched real data well, validating model performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Each year treated as an **independent observation** ‚Äî doesn't capture time trends  
- No policy or energy source data included ‚Äî can't assess causation or mitigation  
- Correlation ‚â† causation: we identified patterns, not drivers
